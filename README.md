# Huffman Encoding

Huffman coding is an efficient method of compressing data without losing information.

Huffman coding provides an efficient, unambiguous code by analyzing the frequencies that certain symbols appear in a message. Symbols that appear more often will be encoded as a shorter-bit string while symbols that aren't used as much will be encoded as longer strings.

Huffman coding works by using a frequency-sorted binary tree to encode symbols.
